PACKAGE INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS:
- dlib
- face_recognition
- opencv
- pillow
- pickle
- cmake
- os
- glib
- requests
- imutils
- dash
- base64
- beautifulsoup or bs4
- json
- urllib

To visualize the application is necessary install core dash backend and DAQ components
- pip install dash==1.1.1  
- pip install dash-daq==0.1.0 


FOLDERS OUTLINE AND FILE DESCRIPTIONS:

- Main.py (Main file to run)
- README.md
- assets
- capture_image
        - capture_image.py (File that captures and stores images in the corresponding instagram username folder.)
- dataset (Contains folders of instagram usernames. These folders contains images)
- gradient
        - gradient.py (Runs a video feed using gradient images)
- haar
        - cascades (Contains a face cascade file used in haar face detection)
        - face_train.py (Trains the Haar cascade to recognize images from the dataset. Outputs "labels.pickle" and "trainer.yml")
        - faces.py (Runs the trained Haar video feed)
        - Insta_Info_Scraper.py (Pulls and shows the instagram users information to be attached to the Haar video feed)
        - labels.pickle (labels IDs matching names and the corresponding images and saves it in trainer.yml)
        - trainer.yml (output of "labels.pickle" to be used as input when it runs "faces.py".)
        - users.txt (used by "Insta_Info_Scraper.py" to pull the instagram address of the user which is the name of the folder. This file is created by "faces.py" by reading the name of the folder which also has the instagram username )
- hog
        - encode_faces.py (Trains the HOG algorithm to recognize images from the dataset. Outputs "encodings.pickle")
        - encodings.pickle (contains the encoded/trained information of the faces used when the dataset is encoded/trained)
        - hog.py (Runs the trained HOG video feed)
        - Insta_Info_Scraper.py (Pulls and shows the instagram users information to be attached to the HOG video feed)
        - users.txt (used by "Insta_Info_Scraper.py" to pull the instagram address of the user which is the name of the folder. This file is created by "hog.py" by reading the name of the folder which also has the instagram username )
- saved_images (Contains images used for the  user interface.)
        - image_captured
        - stop_image.png
        - training_image.png



STEPS TO RUN THE MODEL

1. Download the packages required from the Package Installation Requirements section of this file.
2. Run Main.py on the python shell or any desired text editor: 
   - Run this file to get the https server (output shown below). 
   - Copy and paste the http address to a Chrome browser.
   - in this case ("http://127.0.0.1:8050/")
   
   Output:
   Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/

   * Serving Flask app "Main" (lazy loading)
   * Environment: production
   [31m   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.[0m
   [2m   Use a production WSGI server instead.[0m
   * Debug mode: on

2. On the web browser:
    - About tab: Reveals the overview of the project
    - Data tab: Contains buttons to perform an action
    - Capture Image: allows the user to capture a new image an store it in the image folder for later training
            - to capture an image for training, first type in the instagram username in the text box.
            - then click Capture Image.
            - this image is stored in a folder with the text input used.
    - Train Algorithm: allows the userto train and encode faces into the algorithms.
            - current images in the folder is used to train the models
    - HOG Webcam: Uses HOG (Histogram of Gradients) facial recognition and presents instagram users information.
    - Haar Webcam: Uses Haar (Haar-like features) facial recognition and presents instagram users information.
    - Stop Webcam: Stops the Haar and HOG outputs.
    - Gradient Demo: Shows the user a gradient view of how the algorithm sees the live feed.
    
    Note: Before clicking any other action after starting any of the webcams, it is necessary to click "Stop Webcam".
