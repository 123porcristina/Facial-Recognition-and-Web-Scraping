STEPS TO RUN THE MODEL

1. Encode_faces.py:
    - Run this file to perform training and encoding of the images in the dataset folder
 
2. Main.py: 
   - Run this file to get the https server. Copy and paste this address to a Chrome browser.

3. Once in the screen, it will present the following information:

 - Tab About: overview of the project
 - Tab Data: contains buttons to perform an action
    - Capture picture: allows to capture a new picture an store it in the image folder
    - Train algorithm: allows to encode faces
    - Facial recognition: allows to open the web camera to do the facial recognition and present basic information 
      obtained from Instagram if the user exists.
    - Stop video: allows to stop the video. 
    
    Note: After initialize facial recognition if you want to push another button please press "STOP VIDEO".
